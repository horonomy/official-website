/**
 * SPA page-view tracker for the self-managed gtag setup (HORO-37).
 *
 * Because we don't use preset-classic's built-in `gtag` plugin (so we can
 * guarantee the Consent-Mode default-denied init runs before the first hit —
 * see `docusaurus.config.ts`), we also lose that plugin's route-change
 * page-view tracking. This client module restores it with the same behaviour:
 * on every client-side navigation it sends an updated `page_path` and a
 * `page_view` event. Consent Mode still gates whether GA stores anything, so
 * this is safe to fire regardless of the visitor's choice.
